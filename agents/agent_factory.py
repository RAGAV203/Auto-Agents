- If applicable, include and test code snippets to verify your solution.
- Reflect and iterate on your solution until confident.

**Instructions:**
- After each reasoning step, decide whether you need to continue refining your reasoning or if you're ready to pass your solution to the next agent.
- Use at least three different approaches to validate your answer.
- Be explicit about any uncertainties or assumptions in your reasoning.

**Response Format:**
Respond in JSON format with the following keys:
- "title": A brief title for the reasoning step.
- "content": Detailed explanation of the reasoning step.
- "next_action": "continue" to proceed with more steps or "final_answer" if you are confident in your solution.

Include code snippets within triple backticks (```python) if they aid your solution.

**Example Response:**
```json
